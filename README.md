Project: Wind Energy Prediction Models
Overview
This repository contains four different machine learning models developed to predict wind energy output. The models utilize various advanced algorithms tailored to handle time series data typical in wind speed measurements from different regions.

Models
1. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
File: GRU ALGO NEW update (1).ipynb
Description: This model uses the GRU architecture, a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly good at capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. It is designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and is often used in sequential data processing.
2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
File: LSTM updatedfinal (1).ipynb
Description: LSTM networks are a kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are widely used for sequence prediction problems and are particularly useful in predicting the energy output based on historical wind speed data.
3. Random Forest
File: RANDOM FOREST.ipynb
Description: This model utilizes a Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble learning method for regression. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees. It is known for its high accuracy, robustness, and ease of use.
4. ConvLSTM
File: convolstm.ipynb
Description: The ConvLSTM model integrates convolutional layers into the LSTM architecture, making it ideal for spatio-temporal data prediction. This model is specifically designed to leverage both spatial and temporal correlations in data like geospatial wind speed measurements.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras, sklearn
Data: The models require time-series data of wind speeds, ideally pre-processed and formatted into sequences suitable for recurrent neural network training.
Usage
Each notebook contains detailed instructions on how to train and evaluate the model using your dataset. Follow the steps in each notebook to reproduce the results or adapt the models to your specific needs.
